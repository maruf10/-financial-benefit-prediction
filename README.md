Findings.

Here It is observed that the Accurecy of the KNN Classifier model is approx 91.4% . I can say that the model performed the good and it could be better by using oversampling method because of imbalanced classified DataSet.

Here a reduction in Marketing cost about 11.4% in marketing cost can be achieved while maintaining 97.6% sales if any person is called a maximum of 6 times.
